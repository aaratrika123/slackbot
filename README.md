Automate responses on Slack chatbot using ChatGPT

Steps:
1. Sign in to Slack
Go to Slack and sign in to your workspace or create a new Slack account if you don't have one.

2. Create or Select Your App
Navigate to your Slack App settings.

3. Navigate to OAuth & Permissions
In your app settings, go to the OAuth & Permissions section.

4. Add Bot Token Scopes
Under Bot Token Scopes, add the necessary scopes required for your application. You can add more scopes later if needed.

5. Install Your Bot
Install the bot to your Slack workspace. This action will generate a Bot User OAuth Access Token, which is the API token needed for your project.

6. Copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token
In the OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs section of your Slack app settings, copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token. This token will be used to authenticate your bot with Slack.

7. Add Your Bot to a Channel
   
   Open Slack and navigate to the channel where you want to use your bot.
   
   Right-click on the channel name, select View Channel Details, then click on Integrations.
   
   Click Add an App and select your bot from the list to add it to the channel.
   
   Now that you have obtained the Bot User OAuth Access Token and added your bot to the desired Slack channel, you can proceed to use this token to initialize the Slack Handler in MindsDB for your chatbot project.

This token allows MindsDB to interact with Slack on behalf of your bot, enabling it to send and receive messages in the configured channels.
